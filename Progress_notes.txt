1. Need to figure out where to visually inspect each of the channels
2. Need to figure out a good way to integrate GUI for user friendliness,
especially needed to prompt user for input after visually inspection
3. Need to figure out how to set up the Create_Behave part of the
analysis
4.Consider the case when part of the data has already been processed.
How to skip the already existed files and continue to the next part of the
script? Does "switch" in this case works?
